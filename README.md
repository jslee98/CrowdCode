# CrowdCode: Backend

CrowdCode allows people from all over the world to code together.

## Website

http://crowdcode1.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/

## Backend API

https://calm-headland-11311.herokuapp.com/

## Built With: Backend

The backend was built by hosting a MongoDB database on an EC2 Amazon Web Server. We then used Node/Express to communicate with the database,
and finally hosted the RESTful API using heroku.

## Download/run

Simply clone the repo (node modules are included in the repo) and run

'npm run dev'

to start the app on http://localhost:3000/

this will launch the backend API. To interact with the endpoint, use /pin, where pin is the pin of the project
